# Contact List Backend

This is a simple backend application for managing contacts using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Installation

To install this project, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. Then, clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies required for the project.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the server on port 3000 by default. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

The server exposes three endpoints for creating, retrieving and deleting contacts:

- `GET /api/contacts`: This endpoint returns all the contacts associated with a user profile. The user profile is obtained from an authorization header that contains a JSON Web Token (JWT). The JWT should be generated by a third-party authentication service such as Auth0 or Firebase. The response is a JSON object with a `status`, a `data` property that contains an array of contacts, and optionally an `error` property if something went wrong.

- `POST /api/contacts`: This endpoint creates a new contact for a user profile. The user profile is obtained from an authorization header that contains a JWT as described above. The request body should be a JSON object with two properties: `name` and `contact_number`. Both properties are required and should be strings. The response is a JSON object with a `status`, a `message`, a `data` property that contains the created contact, and optionally an `error` property if something went wrong.

- `DELETE /api/contacts/:id`: This endpoint deletes an existing contact by its ID. The ID should be a valid MongoDB ObjectID string. The user profile is obtained from an authorization header that contains a JWT as described above. The response is a JSON object with a `status`, a `message`, and optionally an `error` property if something went wrong.

- `update /api/contacts/:id`: This endpoint updates an existing contact by its ID. The ID should be a valid MongoDB ObjectID string. The user profile is obtained from an authorization header that contains a JWT as described above. The request body should be a JSON object with two properties: `name` and `contact_number`.The response is a JSON object with a `status`, a `message`, and optionally an `error` property if something went wrong.
